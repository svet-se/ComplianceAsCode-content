<title>Updating Software</title>
<description>The <tt>yum</tt> command line tool is used to install and
update software packages. The system also provides a graphical
software update tool in the <b>System</b> menu, in the <b>Administration</b> submenu,
called <b>Software Update</b>.
<br /><br />
Oracle Linux system contain an installed software catalog called
the RPM database, which records metadata of installed packages. Consistently using
<tt>yum</tt> or the graphical <b>Software Update</b> for all software installation
allows for insight into the current inventory of installed software on the system.

<title>Ensure Oracle Linux GPG Key Installed</title>
<description>
To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software
packages come from Oracle (and to connect to the Unbreakable Linux Network to
receive them), the Oracle GPG key must properly be installed.
To install the Oracle GPG key, run:
<pre>$ sudo uln_register</pre>
If the system is not connected to the Internet,
then install the Oracle GPG key from trusted media such as
the Oracle installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted
in <tt>/media/cdrom</tt>, use the following command as the root user to import
it into the keyring:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="the Oracle GPG Key is not installed">
To ensure that the GPG key is installed, run:
<pre>$ rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey</pre>
The command should return the string below:
<pre>gpg(Oracle OSS group (Open Source Software group) &lt;build@oss.oracle.com&gt;</pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>
Changes to software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures
the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided
by a trusted vendor. The Oracle GPG key is necessary to
cryptographically verify packages are from Oracle.

<title>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main Yum Configuration</title>
<description>The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether
RPM packages' signatures are always checked prior to installation.
To configure yum to check package signatures before installing
them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt> in
the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="GPG checking is not enabled">
To determine whether <tt>yum</tt> is configured to use <tt>gpgcheck</tt>,
inspect <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt> and ensure the following appears in the
<tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>
A value of <tt>1</tt> indicates that <tt>gpgcheck</tt> is enabled. Absence of a
<tt>gpgcheck</tt> line or a setting of <tt>0</tt> indicates that it is
disabled.

Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security 
of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with
and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.
<br />
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must
be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.
<br />
Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation
validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from
a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and
that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed
certificates are disallowed by this requirement. Certificates
used to verify the software must be from an approved Certificate
Authority (CA).

<title>Ensure Software Patches Installed</title>
<description>If the system is joined to the ULN or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
<pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
can be manually downloaded from the ULN and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.

If the system is joined to the ULN or a yum server which provides updates, invoking the following command will
indicate if updates are available:

If the system is not configured to update from one of these sources,
run the following command to list when each package was last updated:

Compare this to Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) listed at

<rationale>
Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.

title: 'Configure the Scheduler Service Network Address'

description: |-
    To ensure the Scheduler service is bound to a secure loopback
    address, edit the Scheduler pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node and set the below parameter:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      schedulerArguments:
        address:
        - 127.0.0.1</pre>

rationale: |-
    The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used
    for health and metrics information and is available without authentication
    or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface,
    to minimize the cluster's attack surface.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'scheduler network address is not set to the IP address of the loopback device'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A2 address /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>false</tt>.

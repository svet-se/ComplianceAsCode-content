title: 'Ensure RotateKubeletServerCertificate is set to True'

description: 'Enable kubelet server certificate rotation on controller-manager.'

rationale: |-
  RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate
  after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing
  credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that there are no downtimes
  due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad.
  Note: This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from
  the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g.
  Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself.

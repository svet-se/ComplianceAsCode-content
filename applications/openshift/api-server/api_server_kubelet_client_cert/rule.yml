title: 'Ensure that the --kubelet-client-certificate argument is set as appropriate'

description: |-
    To enable certificate based kubelet authentication, follow the OpenShift
    documentation and setup the TLS connection between the API Server and
    kubelets. Then, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master
    node and set the kubelet client certificate parameters as
    below:

    <pre>--kubelet-client-certificate=<i>/path/to/client-certificate-file</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    By default the API Server does not authenticate itself to the kublet's
    HTTPS endpoints. Requests from the API Server are treated anonymously.
    Configuring certificate-based kubelet authentication ensures that the
    API Server authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.

severity: high

ocil_clause: '<tt>--kubelet-client-certificate</tt> parameters do not point to valid certificate files'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
     <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--kubelet-client-certificate</tt> and
    argument exists and is set as appropriate.

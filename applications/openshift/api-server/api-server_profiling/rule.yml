title: 'Disable Profiling on the API Server'

description: |-
    To disable profiling, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set <tt>profiling</tt> to <tt>false</tt>:
    <pre>schedulerArguments:
      profiling:
      - 'false'</pre>

rationale: |-
    Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It
    generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be
    exploited to uncover system and program details. If the profiler is not
    needed for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn off for
    reduction of potential attack surface.

severity: low

ocil_clause: '<tt>profiling</tt> is enabled (set to value of <tt>true</tt>)'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 profiling</pre>
    Verify that the <tt>profiling</tt> argument is <tt>false</tt>.

title: 'Verify User Who Owns The Etcd Write-Ahead-Log Files'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_file_owner(file="/var/lib/etcd/member/wal/.*", owner="root") }}}

rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for
    persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should
    be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by
    <pre>root:root</pre>.

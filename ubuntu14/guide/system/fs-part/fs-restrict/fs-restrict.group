title: 'filesystem rights management'

description: |-
    Adding filesystem specific hardening seriously limits various exploitation vectors based on
      filesystem invalid usage, such as invalid file types in invalid places (devices or setuid root files in external
    media, executable file in insecure filesystems, etc.). Some of these hardening require an efficient system
    partitioning.

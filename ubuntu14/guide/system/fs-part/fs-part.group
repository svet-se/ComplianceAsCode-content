title: 'Hardening the filesystem'

description: |-
    Hardening the filesystem and its usage is an efficient way to ensure an efficient separation of services,
    data and configurations while ensuring a more precise management of filesystem level access rights, enabling deactivation
    of some specific rights at the filesystem level. Moreover, the Linux Virtual file system support various hardening mechanisms
    that can be set using sysctl.

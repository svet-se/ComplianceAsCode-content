title: 'BIND and Crypto Policies'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    BIND is supported by crypto policy, but the library may be configured to ignore it.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings are obeyed, ensure that the <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>
    includes the appropriate configuration:
    In the <tt>options</tt> section of <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>, make sure that the following line
    is not commented out or superseded by later includes:
    <tt>include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config";</tt>

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the BIND service violate expectations,
    and makes system configuration more fragmented.

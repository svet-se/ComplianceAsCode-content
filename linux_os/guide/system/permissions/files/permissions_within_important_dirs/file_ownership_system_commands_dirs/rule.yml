title: 'Verify that system commands files are group owned by root '

description: |-
    System commands files are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin 
    /sbin 
    /usr/bin 
    /usr/sbin 
    /usr/local/bin 
    /usr/local/sbin
    </pre>
    All files in these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> user. 
    If the directory, or any file in these directories, is found to be owned 
    by a user other than root correct its ownership with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>FILE</i></pre>
rationale: |-
    If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software
    libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the 
    appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management 
    process.
    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries 
    that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. 
    Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with 
    escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be 
    allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes 
    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

title: 'Set Daemon Umask'

description: |-
    The file <tt>/etc/init.d/functions</tt> includes initialization
    parameters for most or all daemons started at boot time. Many daemons
    on the system already individually restrict themselves to
    a umask of <tt>077</tt> in their own init scripts. By default, the umask of
    <tt>022</tt> is set which prevents creation of group- or world-writable files.
    To set the umask for daemons expected by the profile, edit the following line:
    <pre>umask <i><sub idref="var_umask_for_daemons" /></i></pre>

rationale: |-
    The umask influences the permissions assigned to files created by a
    process at run time. An unnecessarily permissive umask could result in files
    being created with insecure permissions.

ocil: |-
    To check the value of the <tt>umask</tt>, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep umask /etc/init.d/functions</pre>
    The output should show <tt><sub idref="var_umask_for_daemons" /></tt>.

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        Setting the umask to too restrictive a setting can cause serious errors at
        runtime.

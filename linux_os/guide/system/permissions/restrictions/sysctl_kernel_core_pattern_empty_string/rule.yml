title: 'Disable storing core dumps'

description: |-
    The <tt>kernel.core_pattern</tt> option specifies the core dumpfile pattern
    name. It can be set to an empty string <tt>''</tt>. In this case, the kernel
    behaves differently based on another related option. If
    <tt>kernel.core_uses_pid</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt>, then a file named as
    <tt>.PID</tt> (where <tt>PID</tt> is process ID of the crashed process) is
    created in the working directory. If <tt>kernel.core_uses_pid</tt> is set to
    <tt>0</tt>, no coredump is saved.
    {{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="kernel.core_pattern", value="''") }}}'

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is generally useful
    only for developers trying to debug problems.

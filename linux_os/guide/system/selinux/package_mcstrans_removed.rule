title: 'Uninstall mcstrans Package'

description: |-
    The <tt>mcstransd</tt> daemon provides category label information
    to client processes requesting information. The label translations are defined
    in <tt>/etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf</tt>.
    <yum-macro install="false" package="mcstrans" />

rationale: |-
    Since this service is not used very often, disable it to reduce the
    amount of potentially vulnerable code running on the system.

    NOTE: This rule was added in support of the CIS RHEL6 v1.2.0 benchmark. Please
    note that Red Hat does not feel this rule is security relevant.

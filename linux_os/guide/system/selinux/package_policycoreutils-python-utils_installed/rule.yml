rationale: |-
    Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities
    with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux.
    The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural components originally
    developed to improve security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components
    provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control
    policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
    Control, and Multi-level Security.

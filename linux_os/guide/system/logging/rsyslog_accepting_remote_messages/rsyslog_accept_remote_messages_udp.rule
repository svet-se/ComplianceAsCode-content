title: 'Enable rsyslog to Accept Messages via UDP, if Acting As Log Server'

description: |-
    The <tt>rsyslog</tt> daemon should not accept remote messages
    unless the system acts as a log server.
    If the system needs to act as a central log server, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> to enable reception of messages over UDP:
    <pre>$ModLoad imudp
    $UDPServerRun 514</pre>

rationale: |-
    Many devices, such as switches, routers, and other Unix-like systems, may only support
    the traditional syslog transmission over UDP. If the system must act as a log server,
    this enables it to receive their messages as well.

title: 'Enable rsyslog to Accept Messages via TCP, if Acting As Log Server'

description: |-
    The <tt>rsyslog</tt> daemon should not accept remote messages
    unless the system acts as a log server.
    If the system needs to act as a central log server, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> to enable reception of messages over TCP:
    <pre>$ModLoad imtcp
    $InputTCPServerRun 514</pre>

rationale: |-
    If the system needs to act as a log server, this ensures that it can receive
    messages over a reliable TCP connection.

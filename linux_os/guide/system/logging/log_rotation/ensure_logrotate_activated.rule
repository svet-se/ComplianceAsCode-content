title: 'Ensure Logrotate Runs Periodically'

description: "The <tt>logrotate</tt> utility allows for the automatic rotation of \nlog files.  The frequency of rotation is specified in <tt>/etc/logrotate.conf</tt>, \nwhich triggers a cron task.  To configure logrotate to run daily, add or correct \nthe following line in <tt>/etc/logrotate.conf</tt>:\n<pre># rotate log files <i>frequency</i>\ndaily</pre>"

rationale: |-
    Log files that are not properly rotated run the risk of growing so large
    that they fill up the /var/log partition. Valuable logging information could be lost
    if the /var/log partition becomes full.

ocil_clause: 'logrotate is not configured to run daily'

ocil: "To determine the status and frequency of logrotate, run the following command:\n<pre>$ sudo grep logrotate /var/log/cron*</pre>\nIf logrotate is configured properly, output should include references to \n<tt>/etc/cron.daily</tt>."

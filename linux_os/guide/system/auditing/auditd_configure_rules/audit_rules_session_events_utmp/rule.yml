title: 'Record Attempts to Alter Process and Session Initiation Information utmp'

description: |-
    The audit system already collects process information for all
    users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following lines to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to watch for attempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing such process information:
    <pre>-w /var/run/utmp -p wa -k session</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to watch for attempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing such process information:
    <pre>-w /var/run/utmp -p wa -k session</pre>

rationale: |-
    Manual editing of these files may indicate nefarious activity, such
    as an attacker attempting to remove evidence of an intrusion.

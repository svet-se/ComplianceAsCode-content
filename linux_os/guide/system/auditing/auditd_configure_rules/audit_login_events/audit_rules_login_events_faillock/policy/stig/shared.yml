     {{{ full_name }}} must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect /var/run/faillock.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} generates audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/var/run/faillock" with the following command:

    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep var/run/faillock

    -w /var/run/faillock -p wa -k logins

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/var/run/faillock".

    Add or update the following file system rule to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

    -w /var/run/faillock -p wa -k logins

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

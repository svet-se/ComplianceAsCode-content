title: 'Configure immutable Audit login UIDs'

description: |-
    Configure kernel to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are set.
    Changing login UIDs while this configuration is enforced requires special capabilities which
    are not available to unprivileged users.

    The following rules configure audit as described above:
    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>

    The <tt>Audit</tt> provides pre-configured  rules in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt>.
    The above content can be found in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules/11-loginuid.rules</tt>.
    To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the
    <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d/</tt> directory:
    <pre>
    cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/11-loginuid.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/
    </pre>

    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>

rationale: |-
    If modification of login UIDs is not prevented, they can be changed by unprivileged users and
    make auditing complicated or impossible.

ocil_clause: 'the file does not exist or the content differs'

ocil: |-
    To verify that the <tt>Audit</tt> is correctly configured according to recommended rules,
    check the content of the file with the following command:
    <pre>sudo grep -i loginuid-immutable /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>
    The output has to contain a non commented line as follows:
    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>

template:
    name: lineinfile
    vars:
        path: /etc/audit/rules.d/11-loginuid.rules
        text: "--loginuid-immutable"

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} kernel to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are set.

    Make sure the file "/etc/audit/rules.d/11-loginuid.rules" contains the following content:

    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>

    If the file doesn't exist, it can be copied from <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt>
    using the next command

    <pre>
    cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/11-loginuid.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/
    </pre>

    Then, run the following commands:

    $ sudo chmod o-rwx "/etc/audit/rules.d/11-loginuid.rules"
    $ sudo augenrules --load

srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} audit system must protect logon UIDs from unauthorized change.

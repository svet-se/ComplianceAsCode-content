title: 'Configure auditing with rules in 10-base-config'

description: |-
    Configure audit to use rules located in the 10-base-config.rules file.

    Audit defines groups of rules in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt> to satisfy specific policies.

    To fulfill requirements for compliance with OSPP v4.2.1, the file 10-base-config.rules is necessary.

    Copy the file located at <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules/10-base-config.rules</tt> to <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>
    cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/10-base-config.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/
    </pre>



rationale: |-
    The audit rules defined in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt> are the recommended way to meet compliance with OSPP v4.2.1.

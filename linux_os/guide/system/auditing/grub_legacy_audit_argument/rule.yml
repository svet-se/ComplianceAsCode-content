title: 'Enable Auditing for Processes Which Start Prior to the Audit Daemon'

description: |-
    To ensure all processes can be audited, even
    those which start prior to the audit daemon, add the argument
    <tt>audit=1</tt> to the kernel line in <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt>, in the manner below:
    <pre>kernel /vmlinuz-version ro vga=ext root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet audit=1</pre>

rationale: |-
    Each process on the system carries an "auditable" flag which
    indicates whether its activities can be audited. Although <tt>auditd</tt>
    takes care of enabling this for all processes which launch after it
    does, adding the kernel argument ensures it is set for every
    process during boot.

ocil_clause: 'auditing is not enabled at boot time'

ocil: |-
    Inspect the kernel boot arguments (which follow the word <tt>kernel</tt>) in
    <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt>. If they include <tt>audit=1</tt>, then
    auditing is enabled at boot time.

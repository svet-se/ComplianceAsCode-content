title: 'Ensure GPG keys are configured'

description: |-
    Most distributions use a package manager such as yum, apt, or zypper to install and 
    update software packages. Patch management procedures may vary widely between enterprises.
    Updates can be performed automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for 
    patch management. Many large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production 
    system before rolling out to production. The main reasons for that are two: very complex 
    heterogenous environments which combine IT products from different vendors, and  
    potential high risk of impact on runing business processes.    

    Most packages managers implement GPG key signing to verify package integrity during
    installation.

rationale: |-
    It is important to ensure that updates are obtained from a valid source to protect 
    against spoofing that could lead to the inadvertent installation of malware on the system.

ocil_clause: 'Your package manager GPG keys are not configured in accordance with site policy'

ocil: |-
    To verify GPG keys are configured correctly for your package manager, 
    one of the following command groups may provide the needed information
    depending on the package manager in use: 
    <pre>$ sudo rpm -q gpg-pubkey --qf '%{name}-%{version}-%{release} --> %{summary}\n'</pre>
    If GPG keys are not configured correctly, you have to update 
    your package GPS keys in accorance with site policy.

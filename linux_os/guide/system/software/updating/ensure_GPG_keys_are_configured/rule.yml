ocil_clause: 'Your package manager GPG keys are not configured in accordance with site policy'

ocil: |-
    To verify GPG keys are configured correctly for your package manager, 
    one of the following command groups may provide the needed information
    depending on the package manager in use: 
    <pre>$ sudo rpm -q gpg-pubkey --qf '%{name}-%{version}-%{release} --> %{summary}\n'</pre>
    If GPG keys are not configured correctly, you have to update 
    your package GPS keys in accorance with site policy.

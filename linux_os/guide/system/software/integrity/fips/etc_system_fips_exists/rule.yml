title: Ensure '/etc/system-fips' exists

description: |-
    On a system where FIPS mode is enabled, <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt> must exist.
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

severity: high

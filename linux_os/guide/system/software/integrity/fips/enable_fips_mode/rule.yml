title: Enable FIPS Mode

description: |-
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>
    <br />
    The <tt>fips-mode-setup</tt> command completes the installation of FIPS
    modules by calling <tt>fips-finish-install</tt>. Then, it changes the
    system crypto policy to FIPS by calling <tt>update-crypto-policies</tt>
    tool. Also, the command modifies the boot loader configuration to add
    <tt>fips=1</tt> and <tt>boot=&lt;boot-device&gt;</tt> options to the kernel
    command line.
    <br />
    On a system running in FIPS mode, the kernel FIPS mode flag
    (<tt>/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled</tt>) should be set to <tt>1</tt> and
    the <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt> should exist. The system crypto policy should
    be set to FIPS in <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/config</tt>. Also, the Dracut
    <tt>fips</tt> module should be loaded. Furthermore, the system running in
    FIPS mode should be FIPS certified.

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'FIPS mode is not enabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that FIPS is enabled properly, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --check</pre>
    The output should contain the following:
    <pre>FIPS mode is enabled.</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The ability to enable FIPS does not denote FIPS compliancy or certification.
        Red Hat, Inc. and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are respectively FIPS certified and compliant. Community
        projects such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, etc. do not necessarily meet FIPS certification and compliancy.
        Therefore, non-certified vendors and/or projects do not meet this requirement even if technically feasible.

title: 'Configure kernel to trust the CPU random number generator'

description: |-
    To configure the Linux kernel to trust the CPU hardware random number
    generator, make sure that <tt>random.trust_cpu=on</tt> is configured as a boot
    parameter by running the following command:
    <pre>sudo grub2-editenv - set "$(grub2-editenv - list | grep kernelopts) random.trust_cpu=on"</pre>

rationale: |-
    The Linux kernel offers an option which signifies if the kernel should trust
    data provided by CPU hardware random number generator. Hardware random
    number generators can provide random data very quickly and are used to generate random cryptographic keys. They can
    be useful during boot time when other means of getting random data can be
    slow because there is not yet enough entropy in the system.

ocil_clause: 'the kernel is not configured to trust the CPU RNG'

ocil: |-
    Make sure that the kernel is configured to trust the CPU RNG by following
    commands. To check if the option was correctly configured at kernel compile
    time, run the following command:
    <pre>grep -q CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU=y /boot/config-`uname -r`</pre>
    If the command does not return any output, then the option is not compiled
    in. To check if the option is configured through boot parameter, run the
    following command:
    <pre>sudo grep 'kernelopts.*random\.trust_cpu=on.*' /boot/grub2/grubenv</pre>
    If the command does not return any output, then the boot parameter is
    missing.

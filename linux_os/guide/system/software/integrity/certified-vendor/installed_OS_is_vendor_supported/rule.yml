title: 'The Installed Operating System Is Vendor Supported'

description: |-
    The installed operating system must be maintained by a vendor.
    {{% if product == "ol7" %}}
    Oracle Linux is supported by Oracle Corporation. As the Oracle
    Linux vendor, Oracle Corporation is responsible for providing security patches.
    {{% else %}}
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux is supported by Red Hat, Inc. As the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux vendor, Red Hat, Inc. is responsible for providing security patches.
    {{% endif %}}


rationale: |-
    An operating system is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to
    provide security patches for the product.  With an unsupported release, it
    will not be possible to resolve any security issue discovered in the system
    software.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        There is no remediation besides switching to a different operating system.

    the following command:
    <pre>$ grep -i "red hat" /etc/redhat-release</pre>

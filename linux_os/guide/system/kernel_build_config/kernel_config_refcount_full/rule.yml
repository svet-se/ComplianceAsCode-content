title: 'Perform full reference count validation'

description: |-
    Enabling this switches the refcounting infrastructure from a fast unchecked atomic_t
    implementation to a fully state checked implementation, which can have a slight
    impact in performance.
    This configuration is available from kernel 4.13, but may be available if backported
    by distros.

    {{{ kernel_build_config_describe_config("CONFIG_REFCOUNT_FULL", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    Refcounting provides protections against various use-after-free conditions that can be
    used in security flaw exploits.

warnings:
    {{{ kernel_build_config_warning() | indent(4) }}}

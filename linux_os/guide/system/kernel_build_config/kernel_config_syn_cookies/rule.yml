title: 'Enable TCP/IP syncookie support'

description: |-
    Normal TCP/IP networking is open to an attack known as SYN flooding.
    It is denial-of-service attack that prevents legitimate remote users from being able to connect
    to your computer during an ongoing attack.

    When enabled the TCP/IP stack will use a cryptographic challenge protocol known as SYN cookies
    to enable legitimate users to continue to connect, even when your machine is under attack.

rationale: |-
    SYN cookies provide protection against SYN flooding attacks.

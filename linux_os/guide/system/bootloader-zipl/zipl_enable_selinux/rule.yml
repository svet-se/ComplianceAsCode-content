title: 'Ensure SELinux Not Disabled in zIPL'

description: |-
    To ensure SELinux is not disabled at boot time,
    check that no boot entry in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> has <tt>selinux=0</tt>
    included in its options.
    Make sure <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt> doesn't contain <pre>image = </pre> setting,
    as {{{ full_name }}} adheres to Boot Loader Specification (BLS).
    And run <pre>zipl</pre> command so that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is updated.

rationale: |-
    Disabling a major host protection feature, such as SELinux, at boot time prevents
    it from confining system services at boot time.  Further, it increases
    the chances that it will remain off during system operation.

ocil_clause: 'SELinux is disabled at boot time'

ocil: |-
    To check that selinux is not disabled at boot time;
    Check that no boot entry disables selinux:
    <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\bselinux=0\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
    No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that disables SELinux.

    Check that no image file is specified in <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
    <pre>grep -R "^image\s*=" /etc/zipl.conf</pre>
    No line should be returned, if a line is returned zipl may load a different kernel than intended.

    And make sure that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is newer than <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>
    and <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
    <pre>find /boot/loader/entries/*.conf /etc/zipl.conf -newer /boot/bootmap</pre>
    No line should be returned, if a line is returned <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> needs to be regenerated.

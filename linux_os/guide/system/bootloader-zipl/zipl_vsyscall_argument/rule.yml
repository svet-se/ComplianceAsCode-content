title: 'Disable vsyscalls in zIPL'

description: |-
    To disable use of virtual syscalls,
    check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>vsyscall=none</tt>
    included in its options.
    Make sure <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt> doesn't contain <pre>image = </pre> setting,
    as {{{ full_name }}} adheres to Boot Loader Specification (BLS).
    And run <pre>zipl</pre> command so that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is updated.

    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to disable virtual syscalls,
    add <pre>vsyscall=none</pre> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification or
    reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be
    detected and prevented.
    This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost.
    Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.

ocil_clause: 'vsyscalls are enabled'

ocil: |-
  To check that virtual syscalls are disabled at boot time, check all boot entries with following command:
  <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\bvsyscall=none\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that doesn't disable virtual syscalls.

  Check that no image file is specified in <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
  <pre>grep -R "^image\s*=" /etc/zipl.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, if a line is returned zipl may load a different kernel than intended.

  And make sure that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is newer than <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>
  and <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
  <pre>find /boot/loader/entries/*.conf /etc/zipl.conf -newer /boot/bootmap</pre>
  No line should be returned, if a line is returned <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> needs to be regenerated.

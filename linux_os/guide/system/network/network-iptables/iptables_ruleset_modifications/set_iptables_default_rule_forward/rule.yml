title: 'Set Default iptables Policy for Forwarded Packets'

description: |-
    To set the default policy to DROP (instead of ACCEPT) for
    the built-in FORWARD chain which processes packets that will be forwarded from
    one interface to another,
    add or correct the following line in
    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt>:
    <pre>:FORWARD DROP [0:0]</pre>

rationale: |-
    In <tt>iptables</tt>, the default policy is applied only after all
    the applicable rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the
    default policy to <tt>DROP</tt> implements proper design for a firewall, i.e.
    any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be
    accepted.

ocil_clause: 'the default policy for the FORWARD chain is not set to DROP'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to ensure the default <tt>FORWARD</tt> policy is <tt>DROP</tt>:
    <pre>grep ":FORWARD" /etc/sysconfig/iptables</pre>
    The output should be similar to the following:
    <pre>$ sudo grep ":FORWARD" /etc/sysconfig/iptables
    :FORWARD DROP [0:0</pre>

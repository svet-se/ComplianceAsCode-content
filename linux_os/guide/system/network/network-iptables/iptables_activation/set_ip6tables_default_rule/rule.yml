title: 'Set Default ip6tables Policy for Incoming Packets'

description: |-
    To set the default policy to DROP (instead of ACCEPT) for
    the built-in INPUT chain which processes incoming packets,
    add or correct the following line in
    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt>:
    <pre>:INPUT DROP [0:0]</pre>
    If changes were required, reload the ip6tables rules:
    <pre>$ sudo service ip6tables reload</pre>

rationale: |-
    In <tt>ip6tables</tt>, the default policy is applied only after all
    the applicable rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the
    default policy to <tt>DROP</tt> implements proper design for a firewall, i.e.
    any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be
    accepted.

ocil: |-
    If IPv6 is disabled, this is not applicable.
    <br /><br />
    Inspect the file <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> to determine
    the default policy for the INPUT chain. It should be set to DROP:
    <pre>$ sudo grep ":INPUT" /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</pre>

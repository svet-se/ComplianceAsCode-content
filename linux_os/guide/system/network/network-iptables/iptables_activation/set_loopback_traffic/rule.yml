title: 'Set configuration for IPv6 loopback traffic' 

description: |-
    Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. 
    Configure all other interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback 
    network (::1).

rationale: |-
    Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is 
    typically critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface 
    is the only place that loopback network (::1) traffic should be seen, 
    all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an
    anti-spoofing measure.

warnings:
    - general: |-
    Changing firewall settings while connected over network can 
    result in being locked out of the system.

    Verify that the loopback interface is configured:
    # nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'iif "lo" accept'
    iif "lo" accept
    # nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip saddr'
    ip saddr 127.0.0.0/8 counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop

    If IPv6 is enabled, verify that the IPv6 loopback interface is configured:
    # nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip6 saddr'
    ip6 saddr ::1 counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop

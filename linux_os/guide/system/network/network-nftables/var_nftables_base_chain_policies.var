title: 'Nftables Base Chain Policies'

description: |-
    This is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of the chain 
    (i.e, no more rules to be evaluated against).
    Currently there are 2 policies: 
    <tt>accept</tt> this verdict means that the packet will keep traversing the network stack.
    <tt>drop</tt> this verdict means that the packet is discarded if the packet reaches the end 
    of the base chain.

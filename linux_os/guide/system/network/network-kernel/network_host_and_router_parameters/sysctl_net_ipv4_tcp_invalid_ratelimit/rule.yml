title: 'Configure kernel To Rate limit sending of duplicate TCP acknowledgments'

description: |-
    Make sure that the system is configured to rate limit sending of duplicate TCP acknowledgments.
    This measure protects against or limits effects of DoS attacks against the system.
    Set the system to implement rate-limiting measures by adding the following line to <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> or a configuration file in the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d/</tt> directory (or modify the line to have the required value):
    <pre>net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = 500</pre>
    Issue the following command to make the changes take effect:
    <pre># sysctl --system</pre>

rationale: |-
    DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When
    this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must
    operate at degraded capacity.
    <br /><br />
    This requirement addresses the configuration of
    the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or
    are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS
    attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of
    technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS
    attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing
    increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce
    the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

ocil_clause: 'rate limiting of duplicate TCP acknowledgments is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To verify that the operating system protects against or limits the effects of DoS
    attacks by ensuring implementation of rate-limiting measures
    on impacted network interfaces, run the following command:
    <pre># grep 'net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*</pre>
    The command should output the following line:
    <pre>/etc/sysctl.conf:net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = 500</pre>
    The file where the line has been found can differ, but it must be either <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>
    or a file located under the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d/</tt> directory.

template:
    name: sysctl
    vars:
        sysctlvar: net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit
        sysctlval: 500

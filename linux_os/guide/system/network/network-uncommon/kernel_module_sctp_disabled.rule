title: 'Disable SCTP Support'

description: |-
    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a
    transport layer protocol, designed to support the idea of
    message-oriented communication, with several streams of messages
    within one connection.
    <module-disable-macro module="sctp" />

rationale: |-
    Disabling SCTP protects
    the system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.

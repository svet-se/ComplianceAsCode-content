srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must disable the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) kernel module.

vuldiscussion: |-
    It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

    Failing to disconnect unused protocols can result in a system compromise.

    The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol, designed to support the idea of message-oriented communication, with several streams of messages within one connection. Disabling SCTP protects the system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.

fixtext: |-
    To configure the system to prevent the sctp kernel module from being loaded, add the following line to the file  /etc/modprobe.d/sctp.conf (or create sctp.conf if it does not exist):

    install sctp/bin/false
    blacklist sctp

title: 'Direct root Logins Not Allowed'

description: |-
    To further limit access to the <tt>root</tt> account, administrators
    can disable root logins at the console by editing the <tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file.
    This file lists all devices the root user is allowed to login to. If the file does
    not exist at all, the root user can login through any communication device on the
    system, whether via the console or via a raw network interface. This is dangerous
    as user can login to the system as root via Telnet, which sends the password in
    plain text over the network. By default, Red Hat Enteprise Linux's
    <tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file only allows the root user to login at the console
    physically attached to the system. To prevent root from logging in, remove the
    contents of this file. To prevent direct root logins, remove the contents of this
    file by typing the following command:
    <pre>
    $ sudo echo &gt; /etc/securetty
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Disabling direct root logins ensures proper accountability and multifactor
    authentication to privileged accounts. Users will first login, then escalate
    to privileged (root) access via su / sudo. This is required for FISMA Low
    and FISMA Moderate systems.

ocil_clause: 'the /etc/securetty file is not empty'

ocil: |-
    To ensure root may not directly login to the system over physical consoles,
    run the following command:
    <pre>cat /etc/securetty</pre>
    If any output is returned, this is a finding.

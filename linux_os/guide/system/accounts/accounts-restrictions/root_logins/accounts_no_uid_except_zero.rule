title: 'Verify Only Root Has UID 0'

description: "If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should \nbe investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or \nhave their UID changed.\n<br />\nIf the account is associated with system commands or applications the UID should be changed\nto one greater than \"0\" but less than \"1000.\" Otherwise assign a UID greater than \"1000\" that\nhas not already been assigned."

rationale: |-
    An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
    with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
    guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
    sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
    access to root privileges in an accountable manner.

ocil_clause: 'any account other than root has a UID of 0'

ocil: "To list all password file entries for accounts with UID 0, run the following command:\n<pre>$ awk -F: '($3 == \"0\") {print}' /etc/passwd</pre>\nThis should print only one line, for the user root.\n<br />\nIf there is a finding, change the UID of the failing (non-root) user. If the account is\nassociated with the system commands or applications the UID should be changed to one \ngreater than <tt>0</tt> but less than <tt>1000</tt>. Otherwise assign a UID of\ngreater than <tt>1000</tt> that has not already been assigned."

title: 'All GIDs referenced in /etc/passwd must be defined in /etc/group'

description: 'Add a group to the system for each GID referenced without a corresponding group.'

rationale: |-
    If a user is assigned the Group Identifier (GID) of a group not existing on the system, and a group
    with the Gruop Identifier (GID) is subsequently created, the user may have unintended rights to
    any files associated with the group.

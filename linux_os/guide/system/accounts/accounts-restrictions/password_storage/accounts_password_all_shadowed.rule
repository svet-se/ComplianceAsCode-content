title: 'Verify All Account Password Hashes are Shadowed'

description: |-
    If any password hashes are stored in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> (in the second field,
    instead of an <tt>x</tt> or <tt>*</tt>), the cause of this misconfiguration should be
    investigated. The account should have its password reset and the hash should be
    properly stored, or the account should be deleted entirely.

rationale: |-
    The hashes for all user account passwords should be stored in
    the file <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> and never in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>,
    which is readable by all users.

ocil_clause: 'any stored hashes are found in /etc/passwd'

ocil: |-
    To check that no password hashes are stored in
    <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, run the following command:
    <pre>awk '!/\S:x|\*/ {print}' /etc/passwd</pre>
    If it produces any output, then a password hash is
    stored in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.

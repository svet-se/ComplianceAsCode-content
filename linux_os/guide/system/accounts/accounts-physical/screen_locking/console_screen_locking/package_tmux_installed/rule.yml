title: 'Install the tmux Package'

description: |-
    To enable console screen locking, install the <tt>tmux</tt> package.
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="tmux") }}}
    Instruct users to begin new terminal sessions with the following command:
    <pre>$ tmux</pre>
    The console can now be locked with the following key combination:
    <pre>ctrl+b :lock-session</pre>

rationale: |-
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate
    physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence.
    Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operation system session prior to vacating the vicinity,
    operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
    session lock.
    <br /><br />
    The <tt>tmux</tt> package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.

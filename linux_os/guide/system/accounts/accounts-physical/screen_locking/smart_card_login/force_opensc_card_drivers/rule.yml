title: 'Force opensc To Use Defined Smart Card Driver'

description: |-
    The OpenSC smart card tool can auto-detect smart card drivers; however by
    forcing the smart card driver in use by your organization, opensc will no longer
    autodetect or use other drivers unless specified. This helps to prevent
    users from using unauthorized smart cards. The default smart card driver for this
    profile is <tt><sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" /></tt>. 
    To force the OpenSC driver, edit the <tt>/etc/opensc-<i>ARCH</i>.conf</tt> (where
    <i>ARCH</i> is the architecture of your operating system) file. Look for a line
    similar to:
    <pre># force_card_driver = customcos;</pre> 
    and change it to:
    <pre>force_card_driver = <sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" />;</pre>

rationale: |-
    Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than
    that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI
    (public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.
    Forcing the smart card driver in use by your organization helps to prevent
    users from using unauthorized smart cards.

ocil_clause: 'the smart card driver is not configured correctly'

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt><sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" /></tt> is configured
    as the smart card driver, run the following command changing <i>ARCH</i> for
    the architecture of your operating system:
    <pre>$ grep card_drivers /etc/opensc-<i>ARCH</i></pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>card_drivers = <sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" />;</pre>

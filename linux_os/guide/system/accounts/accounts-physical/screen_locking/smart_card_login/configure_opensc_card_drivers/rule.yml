title: 'Configure opensc Smart Card Drivers'

description: |-
    The OpenSC smart card tool can auto-detect smart card drivers; however,
    setting the smart card drivers in use by your organization helps to prevent
    users from using unauthorized smart cards. The default smart card driver for this
    profile is <tt><sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" /></tt>. 
    To configure the OpenSC driver, edit the <tt>/etc/opensc-<i>ARCH</i>.conf</tt> (where
    <i>ARCH</i> is the architecture of your operating system) file. Look for a
    line similar to:
    <pre># card_drivers = old, internal;</pre>
    and change it to:
    <pre>card_drivers = <sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" />;</pre>

rationale: |-
    Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than
    that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI
    (public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.
    Configuring the smart card driver in use by your organization helps to prevent
    users from using unauthorized smart cards.

ocil_clause: 'the smart card driver is not configured correctly'

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt><sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" /></tt> is configured
    as the smart card driver, run the following command changing <i>ARCH</i> for
    the architecture of your operating system:
    <pre>$ grep card_drivers /etc/opensc-<i>ARCH</i></pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>card_drivers = <sub idref="var_smartcard_drivers" />;</pre>

title: 'Set Last Logon/Access Notification'

description: |-
    To configure the system to notify users of last logon/access
    using <tt>pam_lastlog</tt>, add or correct the <tt>pam_lastlog</tt> settings in
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/postlogin</tt> to read as follows:
    <pre>session     [success=1 default=ignore] pam_succeed_if.so service !~ gdm* service !~ su* quiet
    session     [default=1]   pam_lastlog.so nowtmp showfailed
    session     optional      pam_lastlog.so silent noupdate showfailed</pre>

rationale: |-
    Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding
    their account. Providing users with information regarding the number
    of unsuccessful attempts that were made to login to their account
    allows the user to determine if any unauthorized activity has occurred
    and gives them an opportunity to notify administrators.

title: 'Set Boot Loader Password in grub.conf'

description: |-
    The grub boot loader should have password protection
    enabled to protect boot-time settings.
    To do so, select a password and then generate a hash from it by running the following command:
    <pre>$ grub-crypt --sha-512</pre>
    When prompted to enter a password, insert the following line into <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt>
    immediately after the header comments. (Use the output from <tt>grub-crypt</tt> as the
    value of <b>password-hash</b>):
    <pre>password --encrypted <b>password-hash</b></pre>
    NOTE: To meet FISMA Moderate, the bootloader password MUST differ from the root password.

rationale: |-
    Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures
    users with physical access cannot trivially alter
    important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use,
    and whether to enter single-user mode.

    To verify the boot loader password has been set and encrypted, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep password /etc/grub.conf</pre>
    The output should show the following:
    <pre>password --encrypted <b>password-hash</b></pre>

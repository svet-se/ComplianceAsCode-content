title: 'Configure OpenLDAP Clients'

description: |-
    This section provides information on which security settings are
    important to configure in OpenLDAP clients by manually editing the appropriate
    configuration files.  {{{ full_name }}} provides an automated configuration tool called
    authconfig and a graphical wrapper for authconfig called
    <tt>system-config-authentication</tt>. However, these tools do not provide as
    much control over configuration as manual editing of configuration files. The
    authconfig tools do not allow you to specify locations of SSL certificate
    files, which is useful when trying to use SSL cleanly across several protocols.

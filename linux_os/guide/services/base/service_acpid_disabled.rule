title: 'Disable Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (acpid)'

description: |-
    The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Daemon (<tt>acpid</tt>)
    dispatches ACPI events (such as power/reset button depressed) to userspace
    programs.
    <systemd-service-macro enable="false" service="acpid" />

rationale: |-
    ACPI support is highly desirable for systems in some network roles,
    such as laptops or desktops. For other systems, such as servers, it may permit
    accidental or trivially achievable denial of service situations and disabling
    it is appropriate.

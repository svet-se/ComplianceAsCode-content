title: 'Disable CPU Speed (cpuspeed)'

description: |-
    The <tt>cpuspeed</tt> service can adjust the clock speed of supported CPUs based upon
    the current processing load thereby conserving power and reducing heat.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="cpuspeed") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>cpuspeed</tt> service is only necessary if adjusting the CPU clock speed
    provides benefit. Traditionally this has included laptops (to enhance battery life),
    but may also apply to server or desktop environments where conserving power is
    highly desirable or necessary.

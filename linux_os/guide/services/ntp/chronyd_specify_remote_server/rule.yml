title: 'A remote NTP server for Chrony is configured'

description: |-
    chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It is designed to
    synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
    accurate. More information on chrony can be found at
    {{{ weblink(link="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/") }}}.
    Chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.
    Add or edit server or pool lines to <tt>/etc/chrony.conf</tt> as appropriate:
    <pre>server &lt;remote-server&gt;</pre>
    Multiple servers may be configured.

rationale: |-
    If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time
    synchronization is working properly.

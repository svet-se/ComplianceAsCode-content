title: 'Disable At Service (atd)'

description: |-
    The <tt>at</tt> and <tt>batch</tt> commands can be used to
    schedule tasks that are meant to be executed only once. This allows delayed
    execution in a manner similar to cron, except that it is not
    recurring. The daemon <tt>atd</tt> keeps track of tasks scheduled via
    <tt>at</tt> and <tt>batch</tt>, and executes them at the specified time.
    {{{ systemd_service_disable(service="atd") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>atd</tt> service could be used by an unsophisticated insider to carry
    out activities outside of a normal login session, which could complicate
    accountability. Furthermore, the need to schedule tasks with <tt>at</tt> or
    <tt>batch</tt> is not common.

title: 'Remove the Kerberos Server Package'

description: |-
    Verify the krb5-server package has not been installed on the system with the following
    command:
    <pre>
    $ sudo yum list installed krb5-server

    krb5-server.x86_64 1.17-9.el8 repository
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic
    module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied on to provide confidentiality
    or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised. Currently, Kerberos does not use
    FIPS 140-2 cryptography. FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms
    used to access cryptographic modules use authentication that meets DoD requirements.
    This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a general-purpose computing system.

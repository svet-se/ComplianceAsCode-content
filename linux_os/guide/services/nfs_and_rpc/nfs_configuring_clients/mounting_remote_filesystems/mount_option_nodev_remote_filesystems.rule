title: 'Mount Remote Filesystems with nodev'

description: '{{{ describe_mount(option="nodev", part="any NFS mounts") }}}'

rationale: |-
    Legitimate device files should only exist in the /dev directory. NFS mounts
    should not present device files to users.

ocil_clause: 'the setting does not show'

ocil: "To verify the <tt>nodev</tt> option is configured for all NFS mounts, run the following command:\n<pre>$ mount | grep nfs</pre>\nAll NFS mounts should show the <tt>nodev</tt> setting in parentheses.  This is not applicable if NFS is \nnot implemented."

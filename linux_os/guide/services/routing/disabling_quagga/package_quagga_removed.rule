title: 'Uninstall quagga Package'

description: '{{{ yum_remove(package="quagga") }}}'

rationale: |-
    Routing software is typically used on routers to exchange network topology information
    with other routers. If routing software is used when not required, system network
    information may be unnecessarily transmitted across the network.
    <br />
    If there is no need to make the router software available,
    removing it provides a safeguard against its activation.

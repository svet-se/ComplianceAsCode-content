title: 'Verify the SSH private key files have a passcode'

description: |-
    When creating SSH key pairs, always use a passcode.
    <br />
    You can create such keys with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ssh-keygen -n [passphrase]</pre>
    {{{ full_name }}}, for certificate-based authentication, must enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key.

rationale: |-
    If an unauthorized user obtains access to a private key without a passcode,
    that user would have unauthorized access to any system where the associated
    public key has been installed.

ocil_clause: 'no ssh private key is accessible without a passcode'

ocil: |-
    For each private key stored on the system, use the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/file</pre>
    If the contents of the key are displayed, this is a finding.

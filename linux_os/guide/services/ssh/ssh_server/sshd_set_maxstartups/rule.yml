title: 'Ensure SSH MaxStartups is configured'

description: |-
    To protect a system from denial of service due to a large number of pending
    authentication connection attempts, use the rate limiting function of MaxStartups
    to protect availability of sshd logins and prevent overwhelming the daemon.

rationale: |-
    The MaxStartups parameter specifies the maximum number of concurrent
    unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon. Additional connections will be
    dropped until authentication succeeds or the LoginGraceTime expires for a
    connection. The sshd default is 10. By default, this rule uses the
    CIS-recommended value of 'MaxStartups 10:30:60', which adds 'random early drop'
    functionality.

ocil_clause: 'maxstartups is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To check if MaxStartups is configured, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep MaxStartups /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    If configured, this command should output the configuration.

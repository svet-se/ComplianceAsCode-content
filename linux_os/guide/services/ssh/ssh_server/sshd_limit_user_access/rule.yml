title: 'Limit Users'' SSH Access'

description: |-
    By default, the SSH configuration allows any user with an account
    to access the system. In order to specify the users that are allowed to login
    via SSH and deny all other users, add or correct the following line in the
    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:
    <pre>DenyUsers USER1 USER2</pre>
    Where <tt>USER1</tt> and <tt>USER2</tt> are valid user names.

rationale: |-
    Specifying which accounts are allowed SSH access into the system reduces the
    possibility of unauthorized access to the system.

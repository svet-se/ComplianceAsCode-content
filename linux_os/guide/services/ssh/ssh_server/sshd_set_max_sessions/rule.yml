title: 'Set SSH MaxSessions limit'

description: |-
    The <tt>MaxSessions</tt> parameter specifies the maximum number of open sessions permitted
    from a given connection.  Setting MaxSessions to 1 will effectively disable
    session multiplexing, whereas setting it to 0 will prevent all
    shell, login and subsystem sessions while still permitting forwarding.  The default is 10.
    Add or correct the following lines to 4 or less. To set MaxSessions edit
    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> as follows: <pre>MaxSessions <b>sessions</b></pre>

rationale: |-
    To protect a system from denial of service due to a large number of concurrent
    sessions, use the rate limiting function of MaxSessions to protect availability
    of sshd logins and prevent overwhelming the daemon.

    Run the following command to see what the max sessions number is:
    <pre>$ sudo grep MaxSessions /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be:
    <pre>MaxSessions <sub idref="sshd_max_sessions" /></pre>

title: 'Prevent the Download of Prohibited Mobile Code'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java prevents the download of prohibited mobile code, set
    <tt>deployment.security.blacklist.check</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Mobile code has the potential to cause damage to information systems within
    an organization if used maliciously. Therefore it is important to allow vetted
    mobile code and prevent potentially malicious execution of mobile code.

    Mobile code is defined as software modules obtained from remote systems,
    transferred across a network, and then downloaded and executed on a local system
    without explicit installation or execution by the recipient.

    Usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both the selection and
    use of mobile code installed, downloaded, or executed on all endpoints (e.g.,
    servers, workstations, and smart phones). This requirement applies to
    applications that execute, evaluate, or otherwise process mobile code (e.g., web
    applications, browsers, and anti-virus applications).

ocil_clause: 'it is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java prevents prohibited mobile code from being downloaded,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.blacklist.check=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.blacklist.check=true</pre>

title: 'The Java exception.sites File Exists'

description: |-
    If the Java accepted sites list file does not exist, it can be added
    by running:
    <pre>$ sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/.java/deployment
    $ sudo touch /etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites
    $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites</pre>

rationale: |-
    By default no exception.sites file exists; thus, no prevention of
    unauthorized software. The file must be created. The
    <tt>exception.sites</tt> file is a text file containing single-line URLs for
    accepted risk sites. If there are no AO approved sites to be added to the
    configuration, it is acceptable for this file to be blank. Utilizing a
    whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing the
    execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized software
    decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.

    To verify that the <tt>exception.sites</tt> file exists,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ ls /etc/.java/deployment</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>exception.sites</pre>

title: 'Verify that System Executables Have Root Ownership'

description: |-
    System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/libexec
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/sbin</pre>
    All files in these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> user.
    If any file <i>FILE</i> in these directories is found
    to be owned by a user other than root, correct its ownership with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: 'System binaries are executed by privileged users as well as system services, and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure that their execution of these programs cannot be co-opted.'

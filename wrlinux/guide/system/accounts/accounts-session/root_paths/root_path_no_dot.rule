title: 'Ensure that Root''s Path Does Not Include Relative Paths or Null Directories'

description: |-
    Ensure that none of the directories in root's path is equal to a single
    <tt>.</tt> character, or
    that it contains any instances that lead to relative path traversal, such as
    <tt>..</tt> or beginning a path without the slash (<tt>/</tt>) character.
    Also ensure that there are no "empty" elements in the path, such as in these examples:
    <pre>PATH=:/bin
    PATH=/bin:
    PATH=/bin::/sbin</pre>
    These empty elements have the same effect as a single <tt>.</tt> character.

rationale: |-
    Including these entries increases the risk that root could
    execute code from an untrusted location.

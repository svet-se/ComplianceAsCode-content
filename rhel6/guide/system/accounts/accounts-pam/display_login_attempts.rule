title: 'Set Last Login/Access Notification'

description: |-
    To configure the system to notify users of last login/access
    using <tt>pam_lastlog</tt>, add the following line immediately after <tt>session  required  pam_limits.so</tt>:
    <pre>session       required     pam_lastlog.so showfailed</pre>

rationale: |-
    Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding
    their account. Providing users with information regarding the number
    of unsuccessful attempts that were made to login to their account
    allows the user to determine if any unauthorized activity has occurred
    and gives them an opportunity to notify administrators.

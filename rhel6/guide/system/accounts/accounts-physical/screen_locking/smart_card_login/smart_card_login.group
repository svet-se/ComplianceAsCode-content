title: 'Hardware Tokens for Authentication'

description: |-
    The use of hardware tokens such as smart cards for system login
    provides stronger, two-factor authentication than using a username and password.
    In Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers and workstations, hardware token login
    is not enabled by default and must be enabled in the system settings.

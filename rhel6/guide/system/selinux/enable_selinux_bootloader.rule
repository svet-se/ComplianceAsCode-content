title: 'Ensure SELinux Not Disabled in /etc/grub.conf'

description: |-
    SELinux can be disabled at boot time by an argument in
    <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt>.
    Remove any instances of <tt>selinux=0</tt> from the kernel arguments in that
    file to prevent SELinux from being disabled at boot.

rationale: |-
    Disabling a major host protection feature, such as SELinux, at boot time prevents
    it from confining system services at boot time.  Further, it increases
    the chances that it will remain off during system operation.

ocil_clause: 'SELinux is disabled at boot time'

ocil: |-
    Inspect <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt> for any instances of <tt>selinux=0</tt>
    in the kernel boot arguments.  Presence of <tt>selinux=0</tt> indicates
    that SELinux is disabled at boot time.

title: 'Enable the SELinux Context Restoration Service (restorecond)'

description: |-
    The <tt>restorecond</tt> service utilizes <tt>inotify</tt> to look
    for the creation of new files listed in the
    <tt>/etc/selinux/restorecond.conf</tt> configuration file. When a file is
    created, <tt>restorecond</tt> ensures the file receives the proper SELinux
    security context.
    {{{ describe_service_enable(service="restorecond") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>restorecond</tt> service helps ensure that the default SELinux
    file context is applied to files. This allows automatic correction
    of file contexts created by some programs.

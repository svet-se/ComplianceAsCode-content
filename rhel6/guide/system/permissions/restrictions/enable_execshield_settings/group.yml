title: 'Enable ExecShield'

description: |-
    ExecShield describes kernel features that provide
    protection against exploitation of memory corruption errors such as buffer
    overflows. These features include random placement of the stack and other
    memory regions, prevention of execution in memory that should only hold data,
    and special handling of text buffers. These protections are enabled by default and
    controlled through <tt>sysctl</tt> variables <tt>kernel.exec-shield</tt> and
    <tt>kernel.randomize_va_space</tt>.

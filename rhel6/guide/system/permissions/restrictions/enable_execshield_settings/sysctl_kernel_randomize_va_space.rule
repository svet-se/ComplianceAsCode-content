title: 'Enable Randomized Layout of Virtual Address Space'

description: '{{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="kernel.randomize_va_space", value="2") }}}'

rationale: "Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult\nfor an attacker to predict the location of attack code they have introduced\ninto a process's address space during an attempt at exploitation.  Additionally, ASLR \nmakes it more difficult for an attacker to know the location of existing code\nin order to re-purpose it using return oriented programming (ROP) techniques."

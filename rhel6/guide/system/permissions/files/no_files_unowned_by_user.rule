title: 'Ensure All Files Are Owned by a User'

description: |-
    If any files are not owned by a user, then the
    cause of their lack of ownership should be investigated.
    Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an
    appropriate user.

rationale: |-
    Unowned files do not directly imply a security problem, but they are generally
    a sign that something is amiss. They may
    be caused by an intruder, by incorrect software installation or
    draft software removal, or by failure to remove all files belonging
    to a deleted account. The files should be repaired so they
    will not cause problems when accounts are created in the future,
    and the cause should be discovered and addressed.

title: 'Add nosuid Option to /tmp'

description: |-
    The <tt>nosuid</tt> mount option can be used to prevent
    execution of setuid programs in <tt>/tmp</tt>. The SUID and SGID permissions
    should not be required in these world-writable directories.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="nosuid", part="/tmp") }}}

rationale: |-
    The presence of SUID and SGID executables should be tightly controlled. Users
    should not be able to execute SUID or SGID binaries from temporary storage partitions.

title: 'Ensure rsyslog Does Not Accept Remote Messages Unless Acting As Log Server'

description: |-
    The <tt>rsyslog</tt> daemon should not accept remote messages
    unless the system acts as a log server.
    To ensure that it is not listening on the network, ensure the following lines are
    <i>not</i> found in <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt>:
    <pre>$ModLoad imtcp
    $InputTCPServerRun <i>port</i>
    $ModLoad imudp
    $UDPServerRun <i>port</i>
    $ModLoad imrelp
    $InputRELPServerRun <i>port</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Any process which receives messages from the network incurs some risk
    of receiving malicious messages. This risk can be eliminated for
    rsyslog by configuring it not to listen on the network.

title: 'Record Events that Modify the System''s Discretionary Access Controls - removexattr'

description: |-
    At a minimum the audit system should collect file
    permission changes for all users and root. Add the following to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S removexattr -F auid&gt;=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod</pre>
    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S removexattr -F auid&gt;=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod</pre>

rationale: |-
    The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting to
    gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications
    can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and
    unauthorized users.

        Note that these rules can be configured in a
        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect. Here the system calls
        have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping these system
        calls with others as identifying earlier in this guide is more efficient.

title: 'Ensure <tt>auditd</tt> Collects Information on the Use of Privileged Commands'

description: |-
    At a minimum the audit system should collect the
    execution of privileged commands for all users and root.
    To find the relevant setuid / setgid programs, run the following command
    for each local partition <i>PART</i>:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>PART</i> -xdev -type f -perm -4000 -o -type f -perm -2000 2&gt;/dev/null</pre>
    Then, for each setuid / setgid program on the system, add a line of the
    following form to <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>, where
    <i>SETUID_PROG_PATH</i> is the full path to each setuid / setgid program
    in the list:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=<i>SETUID_PROG_PATH</i> -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged</pre>

rationale: |-
    Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,
    which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but
    limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for
    unusual activity.

ocil: |-
    To verify that auditing of privileged command use is configured, run the
    following command for each local partition <i>PART</i> to find relevant
    setuid / setgid programs:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>PART</i> -xdev -type f -perm -4000 -o -type f -perm -2000 2&gt;/dev/null</pre>
    Run the following command to verify entries in the audit rules for all programs
    found with the previous command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep path /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>
    It should be the case that all relevant setuid / setgid programs have a line
    in the audit rules.

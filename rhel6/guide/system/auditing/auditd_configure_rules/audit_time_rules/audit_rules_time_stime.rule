title: 'Record Attempts to Alter Time Through stime'

description: |-
    Add the following line to <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> for both
    32-bit and 64-bit systems:
    <pre># audit_time_rules
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S stime -k audit_time_rules</pre>
    Since the 64-bit version of the "stime" system call is not defined in the audit
    lookup table, the corresponding "-F arch=b64" form of this rule is not expected
    to be defined on 64-bit systems (the aforementioned "-F arch=b32" stime rule
    form itself is sufficient for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems). The -k option
    allows for the specification of a key in string form that can be used for
    better reporting capability through ausearch and aureport. Multiple system
    calls can be defined on the same line to save space if desired, but is not
    required. See an example of multiple combined syscalls:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -k audit_time_rules</pre>

rationale: |-
    Arbitrary changes to the system time can be used to obfuscate
    nefarious activities in log files, as well as to confuse network services that
    are highly dependent upon an accurate system time (such as sshd). All changes
    to the system time should be audited.

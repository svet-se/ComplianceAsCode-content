title: 'Uncommon Network Protocols'

description: "The system includes support for several network\nprotocols which are not commonly used. Although security vulnerabilities \nin kernel networking code are not frequently\ndiscovered, the consequences can be dramatic. Ensuring uncommon\nnetwork protocols are disabled reduces the system's risk to attacks\ntargeted at its implementation of those protocols."

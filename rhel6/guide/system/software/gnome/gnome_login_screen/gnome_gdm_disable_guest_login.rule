title: 'Disable GDM Guest Login'

description: |-
    The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) can allow users to login without credentials
    which can be useful for public kiosk scenarios. Allowing users to login without credentials
    or "guest" account access has inherent security risks and should be disabled. To do disable
    timed logins or guest account access, set the <tt>TimedLoginEnable</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
    the <tt>[daemon]</tt> section in <tt>/etc/gdm/custom.conf</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[daemon]
    TimedLoginEnable=false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Failure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts operating
    system security.

    To verify that timed logins are disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep -Pzoi "^\[daemon]\\ntimedlogin.*" /etc/gdm/custom.conf</pre>
    The output should show the following:
    <pre>[daemon]
    TimedLoginEnable=false</pre>

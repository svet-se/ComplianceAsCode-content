title: 'Disable the GNOME Login Restart and Shutdown Buttons'

description: |-
    In the default graphical environment, users logging
    directly into the system are greeted with a login screen that allows
    any user, known or unknown, the ability shutdown or restart
    the system. This functionality should be disabled by running the following:
    <pre>$ sudo gconftool-2 --direct \
      --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
      --type bool \
      --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_restart_buttons true</pre>

rationale: |-
    A user who is at the console can reboot the system at the login screen. If restart or shutdown buttons
    are pressed at the login screen, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems
    due to reboot.

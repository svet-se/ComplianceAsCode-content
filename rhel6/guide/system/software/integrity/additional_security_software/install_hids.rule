title: 'Install Intrusion Detection Software'

description: |-
    The base Red Hat platform already includes a sophisticated auditing system that
    can detect intruder activity, as well as SELinux, which provides host-based
    intrusion prevention capabilities by confining privileged programs and user
    sessions which may become compromised.<br />
    In DoD environments, supplemental intrusion detection tools, such as, the McAfee
    Host-based Security System, are available to integrate with existing infrastructure.
    When these supplemental tools interfere with the proper functioning of SELinux, SELinux
    takes precedence.
    <br />

rationale: |-
    Host-based intrusion detection tools provide a system-level defense when an
    intruder gains access to a system or network.

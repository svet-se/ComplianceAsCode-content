title: 'Disable KDump Kernel Crash Analyzer (kdump)'

description: |-
    The <tt>kdump</tt> service provides a kernel crash dump analyzer. It uses the <tt>kexec</tt>
    system call to boot a secondary kernel ("capture" kernel) following a system
    crash, which can load information from the crashed kernel for analysis.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="kdump") }}}

rationale: |-
    Unless the system is used for kernel development or testing, there
    is little need to run the kdump service.

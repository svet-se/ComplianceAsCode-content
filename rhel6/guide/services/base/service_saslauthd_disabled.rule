title: 'Disable Cyrus SASL Authentication Daemon (saslauthd)'

description: |-
    The <tt>saslauthd</tt> service handles plaintext authentication requests on
    behalf of the SASL library. The service isolates all code requiring superuser
    privileges for SASL authentication into a single process, and can also be used
    to provide proxy authentication services to clients that do not understand SASL
    based authentication.
    <chkconfig-service-macro enable="false" service="saslauthd" />

rationale: |-
    The <tt>saslauthd</tt> service provides essential functionality for
    performing authentication in some directory environments, such as those which
    use Kerberos and LDAP. For others, however, in which only local files may be
    consulted, it is not necessary and should be disabled.

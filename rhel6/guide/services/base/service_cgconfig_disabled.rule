title: 'Disable Control Group Config (cgconfig)'

description: |-
    Control groups allow an administrator to allocate system resources (such as CPU,
    memory, network bandwidth, etc) among a defined group (or groups) of processes executing on
    a system. The <tt>cgconfig</tt> daemon starts at boot and establishes the predefined control groups.
    {{{ sysv_service_disable(service="cgconfig") }}}

rationale: |-
    Unless control groups are used to manage system resources, running the cgconfig
    service is not necessary.

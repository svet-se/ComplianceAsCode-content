title: 'Disable xinetd Service'

description: '<chkconfig-service-macro enable="false" service="xinetd" />'

rationale: |-
    The xinetd service provides a dedicated listener service for some programs,
    which is no longer necessary for commonly-used network services. Disabling
    it ensures that these uncommon services are not running, and also prevents
    attacks against xinetd itself.

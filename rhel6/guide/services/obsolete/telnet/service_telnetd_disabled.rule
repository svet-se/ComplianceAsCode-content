title: 'Disable telnet Service'

description: '{{{ describe_service_disable(service="telnet") }}}'

rationale: |-
    The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication, which
    means that data from the login session, including passwords and
    all other information transmitted during the session, can be
    stolen by eavesdroppers on the network. The telnet protocol is also
    subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.

title: 'Remove Rsh Trust Files'

description: |-
    The files <tt>/etc/hosts.equiv</tt> and <tt>~/.rhosts</tt> (in
    each user's home directory) list remote hosts and users that are trusted by the
    local system when using the rshd daemon.
    To remove these files, run the following command to delete them from any
    location:
    <pre>$ sudo rm /etc/hosts.equiv</pre>
    <pre>$ rm ~/.rhosts</pre>

rationale: |-
    Trust files are convenient, but when
    used in conjunction with the R-services, they can allow
    unauthenticated access to a system.

ocil_clause: 'these files exist'

ocil: |-
    The existence of the file <tt>/etc/hosts.equiv</tt> or a file named
    <tt>.rhosts</tt> inside a user home directory indicates the presence
    of an Rsh trust relationship.

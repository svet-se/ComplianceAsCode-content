title: 'Disable DHCP Client in ifcfg'

description: |-
    For each interface on the system (e.g. eth0), edit
    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>interface</i></tt> and make the
    following changes:
    <ul>
    <li> Correct the BOOTPROTO line to read:
    <pre>BOOTPROTO=none</pre>
    </li>
    <li> Add or correct the following lines, substituting the appropriate
    values based on your site's addressing scheme:
    <pre>NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    IPADDR=192.168.1.2
    GATEWAY=192.168.1.1</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>

rationale: |-
    DHCP relies on trusting the local network. If the local network is not trusted,
    then it should not be used.  However, the automatic configuration provided by
    DHCP is commonly used and the alternative, manual configuration, presents an
    unacceptable burden in many circumstances.

ocil: |-
    To verify that DHCP is not being used, examine the following file for each interface:
    <pre># /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>interface</i></pre>
    Look for the following:
    <pre>BOOTPROTO=none</pre>
    and the following, substituting the appropriate values based on your site's addressing scheme:
    <pre>NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    IPADDR=192.168.1.2
    GATEWAY=192.168.1.1</pre>

title: 'Uninstall DHCP Server Package'

description: |-
    If the system does not need to act as a DHCP server,
    the dhcp package can be uninstalled.
    <yum-macro install="false" package="dhcp" />

rationale: |-
    Removing the DHCP server ensures that it cannot be easily or
    accidentally reactivated and disrupt network operation.

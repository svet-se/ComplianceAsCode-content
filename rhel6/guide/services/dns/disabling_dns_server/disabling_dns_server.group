title: 'Disable DNS Server'

description: |-
    DNS software should be disabled on any machine which does not
    need to be a nameserver. Note that the BIND DNS server software is
    not installed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 by default. The remainder of this section
    discusses secure configuration of machines which must be
    nameservers.

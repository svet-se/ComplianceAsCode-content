title: 'Disable anacron Service'

description: 'The <tt>cronie-anacron</tt> package, which provides <tt>anacron</tt>\nfunctionality, is installed by default. \n{{{ yum_remove(package="cronie-anacron") }}}'

rationale: |-
    The <tt>anacron</tt> service provides <tt>cron</tt> functionality for systems
    such as laptops and workstations that may be shut down during the normal times
    that <tt>cron</tt> jobs are scheduled to run. On systems which do not require this
    additional functionality, <tt>anacron</tt> could needlessly increase the possible
    attack surface for an intruder.

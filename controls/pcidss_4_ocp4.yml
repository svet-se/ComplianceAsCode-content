        are defined and consistently applied. While the tooling and standards can be automated,
        the review of allowed accesses should be manual as different sites may have different
        policies.

        This requirement is not eligible for the customized approach. Whether SAD is permitted to
        be stored prior to authorization is determined by the organizations that manage compliance
        programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers). Contact the organizations of
        interest for any additional criteria. This requirement applies to all storage of SAD, even
        if no PAN is present in the environment. Refer to Requirement 3.2.1 for an additional
        requirement that applies if SAD is stored prior to completion of authorization. This
        requirement does not apply to issuers and companies that support issuing services where
        there is a legitimate issuing business justification to store SAD. Refer to Requirement
        3.3.3 for requirements specifically for issuers. This requirement does not replace how PIN
        blocks are required to be managed, nor does it mean that a properly encrypted PIN block
        needs to be encrypted again.

        This requirement applies to the automated mechanism. It is not intended that the systems

        scope for PCI DSS. The focus of this requirement is on protecting personnel with access to
        system components in-scope for PCI DSS. Meeting this requirement for technical and
        automated controls to detect and protect personnel against phishing is not the same as
        Requirement 12.6.3.1 for security awareness training. Meeting this requirement does not
        also meet the requirement for providing personnel with security awareness training, and
        vice versa. This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will
        be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

      notes: |-
        Examples of NSCs covered by these configuration standards include, but are not limited to,
        firewalls, routers configured with access control lists, and cloud virtual networks. The
        objective of this requirement is to ensure the way that NSCs are configured and operate
        are defined and consistently applied. While the tooling and standards can be automated,
        the review of allowed accesses should be manual as different sites may have different
        policies.

        Changes to network connections and NSCs cannot result in misconfiguration, implementation
        of insecure services, or unauthorized network connections. Changes to network connections
        include the addition, removal, or modification of a connection. Changes to NSC
        configurations include those related to the component itself as well as those affecting
        how it performs its security function. A formal change control process should be in place.

        It appears there is no rule in the project to restrict outbound traffic on the firewall.
        Perhaps a rule to automates this would do more harm than good. Probably a manual
        assessment is more reasonable here.

        NSCs are installed between all wireless networks and the CDE, regardless of whether the
        wireless network is a CDE, such that:
        - All wireless traffic from wireless networks into the CDE is denied by default.
        - Only wireless traffic with an authorized business purpose is allowed into the CDE.

        Wireless interfaces are not expected in servers so they are disabled by default in this

        Trusted and untrusted networks are expected to be different for each environment.

        This requirement is complements 1.2.1 and 1.3.1 requirements.

        - Communications with system components that are authorized to provide publicly accessible
        services, protocols, and ports.
        - Stateful responses to communications initiated by system components in a trusted network.
        - All other traffic is denied.

        This requirement is not intended to apply to storage of account data in volatile memory
        but does apply where memory is being treated as persistent storage (for example, RAM
        disk). Account data can only be stored in volatile memory during the time necessary to
        support the associated business process (for example, until completion of the related
        payment card transaction).

      description: |-
        Security controls are implemented on any computing devices, including company- and
        employee-owned devices, that connect to both untrusted networks (including the Internet)
        and the CDE as follows:
        - Specific configuration settings are defined to prevent threats being introduced into the
        entity's network.
        - Security controls are actively running.
        - Security controls are not alterable by users of the computing devices unless
        specifically documented and authorized by management on a case-by-case basis for a limited
        period.

        To ensure this requirement, a manual analysis of site policy and topology is inevitable.
        From the technical perspective, previous requirements should already cover this
        requirement at some level.

        Examples of NSCs covered by these configuration standards include, but are not limited to,
        firewalls, routers configured with access control lists, and cloud virtual networks. The
        objective of this requirement is to ensure the way that NSCs are configured and operate
        are defined and consistently applied. While the tooling and standards can be automated,
        the review of allowed accesses should be manual as different sites may have different
        policies.

        configurations include those related to the component itself as well as those affecting
        how it performs its security function. A formal change control process should be in place.

        - Security controls are actively running.

title: 'Ensure /var/log/audit Located On Separate Partition'

description: |-
    Audit logs are stored in the <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> directory.  Ensure that it
    has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it
    later using LVM. Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to store all
    audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.

rationale: |-
    Placing <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> in its own partition
    enables better separation between audit files
    and other files, and helps ensure that
    auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out
    of space.

title: 'STIG for Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor'

description: "This is a *draft* profile for STIG. This profile is being developed under the DoD consensus model to become\
    \ a STIG in coordination with DISA FSO.<br /><br />\n\n<p>\n    <strong>Where is the RHV-H STIG?</strong>\n    <ul>\n\
    \        <li>Question: May I deploy a product if no STIG exists?<br />\n            Answer: Yes, based on mission need\
    \ and with DAA approval.\n        </li>\n        <li>Question: What do I use if there is no STIG?<br />\n            Answer:\
    \ DISA FSO developed Security Requirement Guides (SRGs) to address technology areas. In the absence of a STIG, an SRG\
    \ can be used to determine compliance with DoD policies. If there is no applicable SRG or STIG, industry or vendor recommended\
    \ practices may be used. Examples include Center for Internet Security Benchmarks, Payment Card Industry requirements\
    \ or the vendor's own security documentation.\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    <small>Source: http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/Pages/faqs.aspx#STIG</small>\n\

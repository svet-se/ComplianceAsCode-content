  description: "The organization:\n a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment:\
    \ organization-defined personnel or roles]:\n   1. An access control policy that\
    \ addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination\
    \ among organizational entities, and compliance; and\n   2. Procedures to facilitate\
    \ the implementation of the access control policy and associated access controls;\
    \ and\n b. Reviews and updates the current:\n   1. Access control policy [Assignment:\
    \ organization-defined frequency]; and\n   2. Access control procedures [Assignment:\
    \ organization-defined frequency].\n\nSupplemental Guidance: This control addresses\
    \ the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation\
    \ of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy\
    \ and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,\
    \ regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and\
    \ procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies\
    \ and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general\
    \ information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented\
    \ by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations.\
    \ The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for\
    \ particular information systems, if needed. \n\nThe organizational risk management\
    \ strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related control:\
    \ PM-9.\nControl Enhancements: None.\nReferences: NIST Special Publications 800-12,\
    \ 800-100.\n\nAC-1 (b) (1) [at least annually] \nAC-1 (b) (2) [at least annually\

  notes: |-
    Organizational analysis and correlation of audit records across
    different repositories to gain organization-wide
    situational awareness is outside the scope
    of OpenShift configuration.

    To aide in such organizational processes, note that OpenShift's
    Cluster Logging Operator enables OpenShift administrators to
    configure custom pipelines to send OpenShift cluster logs to remote
    log stores. These remote destinations, such as Elastic or
    Splunk endpoints, could be used for information system-wide correlation.

    Documentation regarding how to forward cluster logs using the
    Cluster Logging Operator to specific endpoints can be found at:

    The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.

    Supplemental Guidance:  Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three tiers of risk management (i.e., organizational, mission/business process, and information system) and supports cross-organization awareness. Related controls: AU-12, IR-4.

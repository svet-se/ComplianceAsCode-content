title: 'Disable Red Hat Network Service (rhnsd)'

description: |-
    The Red Hat Network service automatically queries Red Hat Network
    servers to determine whether there are any actions that should be executed,
    such as package updates. This only occurs if the system was registered to an
    RHN server or satellite and managed as such.
    <systemd-service-macro enable="false" service="rhnsd" />

rationale: |-
    Although systems management and patching is extremely important to
    system security, management by a system outside the enterprise enclave is not
    desirable for some environments.  However, if the system is being managed by RHN or
     RHN Satellite Server the <tt>rhnsd</tt> daemon can remain on.

title: 'Minimize the DHCP-Configured Options'

description: |-
    Create the file <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</tt>, and add an
    appropriate setting for each of the ten configuration settings which can be
    obtained via DHCP. For each setting, do one of the following:
    <br />
    If the setting should <i>not</i> be configured remotely by the DHCP server,
    select an appropriate static value, and add the line:
    <pre>supersede <tt>setting value</tt>;</pre>
    If the setting should be configured remotely by the DHCP server, add the lines:
    <pre>request <tt>setting</tt>;
    require <tt>setting</tt>;</pre>
    For example, suppose the DHCP server should provide only the IP address itself
    and the subnet mask. Then the entire file should look like:
    <pre>supersede domain-name "example.com";
    supersede domain-name-servers 192.168.1.2;
    supersede nis-domain "";
    supersede nis-servers "";
    supersede ntp-servers "ntp.example.com ";
    supersede routers 192.168.1.1;
    supersede time-offset -18000;
    request subnet-mask;
    require subnet-mask;</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        In this example, the options nis-servers and
        nis-domain are set to empty strings, on the assumption that the deprecated NIS
        protocol is not in use. It is necessary to supersede settings for unused
        services so that they cannot be set by a hostile DHCP server. If an option is
        set to an empty string, dhclient will typically not attempt to configure the
        service.

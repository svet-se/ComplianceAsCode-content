title: 'Allow IMAP Clients to Access the Server'

description: |-
    The default <tt>firewalld</tt> configuration does not allow inbound
    access to any services. This modification will allow remote hosts to
    initiate connections to the IMAP daemon, while keeping all other ports
    on the server in their default protected state.
    <firewalld-desc-macro port="143" proto="tcp" />

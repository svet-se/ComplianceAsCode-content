title: 'Ensure /home Located On Separate Partition'

description: |-
    If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition
    for <tt>/home</tt> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If
    <tt>/home</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then
    creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the
    mountpoint can instead be configured later.

rationale: |-
    Ensuring that <tt>/home</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the
    setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
    users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.

title: 'Install the dracut-fips Package'

description: |-
    To enable FIPS, the system requires that the <tt>dracut-fips</tt>
    package be installed.
    <yum-macro install="true" package="dracut-fips" />

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

    - functionality: |-
        Running <pre>dracut -f</pre> will overwrite the existing initramfs file.
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The ability to enable FIPS does not denote FIPS compliancy or certification.
        Red Hat, Inc. and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are respectively FIPS certified and compliant. Community
        projects such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc. do not necessarily meet FIPS certification and compliancy.
        Therefore, non-certified vendors and/or projects do not meet this requirement even if technically feasible.
        <br /><br />
        See <b><weblink-macro link="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401vend.htm"/></b> for a list of FIPS certified vendors.
